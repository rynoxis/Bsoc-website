# Conventional Commit Messages

In our project, we follow the convention of using conventional commit messages for all commits. Conventional commit messages provide a standardized format for commit messages, making it easier to understand and track changes in our codebase.

A conventional commit message consists of a concise and structured format:

```
<type>(optional_scope): <your_commit_message>
```

The message includes a type and a description, separated by a colon. Here's a breakdown of each component:

Type: The type indicates the nature of the commit and should be selected from a predefined set of types that are relevant to the changes made. Some common types include:

- feat: for a new feature implementation.
- fix: for a bug fix.
- docs: for documentation changes.
- chore: for maintenance or general housekeeping tasks.
- test: for adding or modifying tests.
- refactor: for code refactoring without changing functionality.
- style: for code style changes (e.g., formatting, indentation).
- perf: for performance optimisations.

Description: The description provides a brief summary of the changes made in the commit. It should be concise but descriptive enough to understand the purpose of the commit.

### Example:

```bash
git commit -m "feat(frontend): Add navbar...."
```
